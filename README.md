# RaveVM: Java to Python Translator

## Overview

RaveVM is a Java to Python code translation tool designed to convert Java code snippets into Python code. This tool is particularly useful for developers transitioning from Java to Python or for those who want to understand how Java constructs can be represented in Python.

## Features

- **Basic Java to Python Translation**: Converts common Java constructs such as classes, methods, loops, and conditionals into their Python equivalents.
- **Support for LWJGL**: Translates OpenGL calls and other LWJGL-specific constructs, making it suitable for game development.
- **Minecraft Support**: Handles Minecraft-specific classes and methods, allowing for the translation of Minecraft modding code.
- **Error Handling**: Basic error handling for invalid Java syntax.
- **User -Friendly Interface**: Simple HTML interface for inputting Java code and displaying the translated Python code.

## Fixed Issues and Enhancements

- **Enhanced Regex Patterns**: Improved regex patterns to cover more Java constructs, including exception handling, interfaces, and complex data types.
- **LWJGL and Minecraft Support**: Added specific translations for LWJGL and Minecraft classes, including rendering and entity management methods.
- **Method Declaration Handling**: Improved handling of method declarations and annotations.
- **Output Formatting**: Ensured that the output is trimmed and formatted correctly for Python.

## Usage

1. **HTML Setup**: Ensure you have the following HTML structure in your file:

    ```html
    <textarea id="javaInput" placeholder="Enter Java code here..."></textarea>
    <button id="translateBtn">Translate</button>
    <pre id="pythonOutput"></pre>
    ```

2. **JavaScript Integration**: Include the RaveVM function in your JavaScript code:

    ```javascript
    // Include the RaveVM function here
    ```

3. **Run the Application**: Open the HTML file in a web browser, enter your Java code in the textarea, and click the "Translate" button to see the translated Python code.

## Example

### Java Input

```java
public class Example {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println("Hello, World!");
    }
}
